# ðŸ§  Cyber Threat Intelligence Fundamentals

Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is the discipline of analyzing threat data to produce actionable insights that enhance decision-making in cybersecurity. Unlike reactive security, CTI is proactive and strategic.

## ðŸ“Œ 1. What is CTI?

> CTI transforms raw threat data into contextual knowledge about adversaries, tools, infrastructure, and intent.

- Informs **incident response** and **threat hunting**
- Supports **strategic planning** and **risk assessments**
- Strengthens **detection engineering** and **SOC playbooks**

## ðŸ”Ž 2. Categories of CTI

| Type         | Description                                     | Example Use Case |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| **Tactical** | Real-time indicators (IOCs: IPs, hashes, etc.)  | Firewall & SIEM rules |
| **Operational** | TTPs of threat actors (from reports, malware) | Detecting behavior patterns |
| **Strategic** | High-level threat trends, geopolitical factors  | Board-level decisions |
| **Technical** | Data from malware, sandbox, traffic logs       | Malware reverse engineering |

## ðŸ§  3. Intelligence Lifecycle

1. **Direction** â€“ Define objectives (e.g., "Who is targeting us?")
2. **Collection** â€“ Gather from OSINT, HUMINT, malware samples
3. **Processing** â€“ Normalize, de-duplicate, enrich
4. **Analysis** â€“ Determine relevance, confidence, priority
5. **Dissemination** â€“ Report to SOC, CISO, etc.
6. **Feedback** â€“ Adjust based on effectiveness

## ðŸ”„ 4. CTI vs Threat Data

- CTI = Data + Context + Analysis + Relevance
- Not all IOCs are intelligence; **without context, theyâ€™re noise**
