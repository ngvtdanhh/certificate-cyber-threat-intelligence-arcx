# 🕵️‍♂️ Threat Actor Profiling

Threat actor profiling is the structured analysis of adversaries’ identities, motivations, capabilities, and behavior. It supports **attribution**, **threat hunting**, and **mitigation planning**.

## 🎯 1. Key Profiling Components

| Component        | Description                                 |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **TTPs**         | Techniques, Tactics, Procedures (MITRE ATT&CK) |
| **Motivation**   | Espionage, Financial gain, Hacktivism       |
| **Infrastructure** | IPs, domains, malware families, botnets     |
| **Attribution**  | Nation-state, APT group, cybercrime gang     |

---

## 🧪 2. Example: APT28 (Fancy Bear)

- **Affiliation**: GRU (Russian military intelligence)
- **Known Tools**: X-Agent, Zebrocy, CHOPSTICK
- **Targets**: NATO, Ukraine, media, elections
- **TTPs**:
  - Spear-phishing with macro-enabled docs
  - Credential dumping (Mimikatz)
  - Command-and-control via cloud infrastructure

---

## 🧰 3. Tools for Profiling

- **MITRE ATT&CK Navigator** – TTP mapping
- **Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIPs)** – Fusion of indicators
- **YARA Rules** – Malware classification
- **WHOIS, Passive DNS** – Infra pivoting

---

## 📎 4. Intelligence Fusion

Combining tactical (IOCs) and strategic (actors’ motives) intelligence forms a **threat profile** that supports:

- SOC detection logic (rule tuning)
- Risk scoring (threat modeling)
- Strategic planning (incident escalation, budget allocation)

---

## 🔐 Pro Tip

Always link threat actor profiles to **campaigns**, **clusters**, or **operation names**. This helps maintain continuity across time, even when attribution changes.
