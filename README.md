## 📝 Course Review

This is one of the most focused CTI introductory courses available. It balances foundational theory with practical workflow guidance that can be integrated into threat hunting, SOC operations, or intelligence reporting.

✅ **What I liked**:
- Emphasis on structured CTI lifecycle and frameworks (e.g., Diamond Model)
- Integration examples with SIEM and MISP
- Clean UI and learner-friendly progression

📌 **To improve**:
- Could include more hands-on exercises or datasets
- Slightly expand coverage on malware analysis correlation
